# PocketSpells (working title)


## The problem

My friend Amalie and I play DnD with friends. Amalie really likes to track her character on paper. But, to keep track of spells (she's a Ranger) can be a hassle. To remember which spells you have, what they do and which situation they are helpfull. 

### What else we tried
We tried printing them on cards. This worked well, but we would always forget to print new ones when she learned something new. She also missed to have a list of all the spells she could choose from when leveling up.

## The solution

I want to make Amalie a spelltracker for her mobile phone. 

- It should feel as simple as paper, but let her search/filter and track spell slots
- It should just keep track of spells, nothing else
- It needs to be worded for new players
- It would be nice if it could also help new players deciding what spells to choose when leveling up, what to prepare and which to cast in a specific situation
    - This is not recomending spells, rather using a language the player understands. "Fun spell", "Attack a single target", "LOTS of damage"

### Notes

Amalie plays a ranger. This is NOT a type with a large amount of spells. The still found it difficult. I'm assuming other classes can have even bigger issues with this, but also that it is especially a problem for new players that maybe doesn't play that often
