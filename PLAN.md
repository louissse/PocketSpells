### PocketSpells (working title)


## The problem

My friend Amalie and I play DnD with friends. Amalie really likes to track her character on paper. But, to keep track of spells can be a hassle. To remember which spells you have and what they do. 

# Whet wlse we tried
We tried printing them on cards. This worked well, but we would always forget to print new ones when the learned something new and she had a hard when she needed to chose new spells.

## The solution

I want to make Amalie a spelltracker for her mobile phone. 

- It needs to feel like the printed paper solution, but with better organization
- It should just keep track of spells, nothing else
- It needs to be worded for new players
- It would be nice if it could also help new players deciding and what spells to choose and which to cast in a specific situation
